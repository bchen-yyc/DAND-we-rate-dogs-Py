# We Rate Dogs_Python
## by Liangbin Chen


## Dataset

The dataset s the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).


## Summary of Findings

- Puppo stage dogs are most popular among rater and audience, while pupper stage dogs are the least popular. 
- The saluki breed is the most popular breed by both raters and audience
- Single dog pictures score higher
